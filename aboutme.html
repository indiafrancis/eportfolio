<h1>About Me</h1>

<div><p>Hi, I'm India Francis. I grew up in Manhattan and lived there my whole life. At a very young age, my mother found me very creative and I took her drawing skills with me to make it into a hobby. I draw mostly my characters then became a writer in middle school. Tons of media influenced my art heavily, specifically anime and cartoon, of course. I specifically enjoy fantasy, horror, psychological, and supernatural. A small wish that sits in the back of my head is to publish a book and get greenlit to be animated. I'm currently on my first semester at BMCC trying to complete my Multimedia and Programming Major! <p></div>
