    <div><p>This vector art made by me shown here is a piece visualized what's it like having a cold. Each star placed on the silhouette are spots that can be affected by a cold or fever. Leaving a hot spot on the body from inflammation. And the cloud on top of them came out of nowhere but, I'll call it the heat lamp. I made this because it would be cool idea to make to visualize what's it like having a cold and get to know more what to use on Illustrator and After Effects. </p></div>
